# To reduce the size of the resulting Docker image, we use a node-slim base
# image with the latest node JS LTS version, group some of the commands
# together in a single layer and add some cleanup.

# Extract the Node JS version in an own "stage", so we don't have to specify it
# multiple times.

# stocks series module. Not sure what's the exact reason for this, but we would
# need to update the reference file.

# don't forget any) and wouldn't reduce the image size much.

# Install flirror via poetry together with all (test) dependencies
# As we are inside a Dockerfile, we don't need poetry to create a virtualenv
# NOTE (felix): Installing poetry in the same python env like the application
# itself is not recommended as poetry might remove some of its own dependencies
# if they are not needed by the appliaction. However, as we don't do anything
# else with poetry after installing the application it shouldn't harm anything
# and keeps the image size smaller as we don't need to create an additional
# python environment.

# Backstop JS sets the entrypoint to "backstop" which doesn't allow us to
